$VL$ "oh, this looks shiny”

$AX$ "Violet, put that down. We can't afford something like that.”

$f$ “that pocket watch is 18 karat gold and built by one of the finest craftsman of our time. Its sure to go splendid with your attire.”

$AX$ "sorry but we're not in the market for jewelry right now.”

$f$ “suit yourself, what can I do for such a handsome face?”

$VL$ "do you know anything about the Rush sisters?”

$f$ “They were here just a couple months ago, but I don't see how that is any of your business.”

$AX$ "oh, uh, Melody's body was found dead earlier this week. We are investigating for harmony, anything you could tell us would really help.”

$f$ “Oh I didn't realize. I'm sorry for being rude. [Pause] That poor girl.”

$AX$ "It's understandable, you were protecting your clients.”

$VL$ "Now tell us everything!”

$F$ “They were having me appraise some jewelry. Melody brought in a stunningly beautiful locket that was worth a lot. Harmony had an equally beautiful ring, but it wasn't worth very much.”

$AX$ "Do you think melody was murdered for her locket?”

$VL$ "hmm, unlikely. Petty theft doesn't often end with bodies in rivers.”

$AX$ "ehh, right.”

$VL$ "better make a note of it anyway.”
