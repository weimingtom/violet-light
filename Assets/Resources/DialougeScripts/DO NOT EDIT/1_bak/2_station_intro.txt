s “Harmony was always jealous of her sister. Sitting back in the shadows, while her sister was in the spotlight.”

a shocked
a “I don’t think th-“

s “So your client, the supposed innocent one, was always living in the shadow, while her sister got all the fame and glory. Even though, she worked so hard. I mean have you SEEN her room? It’s freakin crazy in there! It’s like some sort of music creation dungeon.”

s “Annnd you’re telling me, that she’s still innocent? That she didn’t give in and decide to get rid of the problem? So she could finally be free?”

a thinking
a “Hhmm?”

s shocked
s “Ngh- W-what what do you mean?”

v thinking
a “Ah, I get it. It doesn’t really matter if Harmony was jealous or not. That’s just probably because, not enough to keep her here much longer, let alone put her away.”
