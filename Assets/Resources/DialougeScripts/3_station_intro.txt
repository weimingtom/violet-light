$VL$ "’I hadn't seen my sister since the night before, she went out on some awesome adventure as usual. I didn’t worry though, as sometimes she goes and sings for the less fortunate at night. So I went to bed assuming as such.”
$VL$ "’I left the next morning for the fabric store, as I needed supplies for one of my sister’s clothing pieces. I wake up earlier than Melody usually, so I assumed she made it home safely. I arrived home later, and began my duties tending to the instruments. She hadn’t come down yet so I decided to check on her. I went up and she wasn’t home, I put the ribbon down and went downstairs to find the police at my door. That’s why there was the ribbon in her room.’”
$VL$ "’They arrested me and began searching through my stuff, I tried to ask for help but they kept trying to get me to talk. That didn’t really work though.’”
