$JW$ “That’s quite alright, what can I do for such a handsome face?”
$VL$ “Do you know anything about the Rush sisters?”
$JW$ “Those two lovely sisters were here just a couple months ago, but I don't see how that is any of your business.”
$AX$ “Oh, uh how do I put this... Melody's body was found washed up in the river earlier. We are investigating for harmony, anything you could tell us would really help.”
$JW$ “Oh I didn't realize. I'm sorry for being rude. [wait 1]That poor girl...”
$AX$ “It's understandable, you were protecting your clients.”
$VL$ “Now tell us everything!”
$JW$ “They were having me appraise some jewelry. Melody brought in a stunningly beautiful locket that was worth a lot. Harmony had an equally beautiful ring, but it wasn't worth very much.”
$AX$ “Do you think melody was murdered for her locket?”
$VL$ “Hmm, unlikely. Petty theft doesn't often end with bodies in rivers.”
$AX$ “Ehh, right.”
