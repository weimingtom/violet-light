$VL$ "good evening sir."

$MG$ "Evening ma'am, what can I do you for?"

$VL$ "I was hoping you could tell us if you have noticed anything weird with the music shop recently?"

$MG$ "By 'strange' do you mean something like frequent visits from a certain city rich kid?"

$AX$ "what city rich kid?"

$MG$ "You haven't had the pleasure of meeting the famed Michael George? He's a real piece of work that one. He walks around like his family owns half the city. I mean like they do, but that's beside the point! He's a real suave guy and has all the ladies swooning over him. They can't see that under his fancy car and inviting smile he is a real nasty fella. I ought to show him what a real man looks like."

$AX$ "so you saw him entering the shop a lot?"

$MG$ "well no. But I see his car outside the shop a lot. He has the fanciest car in the whole city ya' know."

$VL$ "Okay, we had better make a note on this 'Michael George' guy."

$AX$ "Got it!"
