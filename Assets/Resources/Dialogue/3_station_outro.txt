$AX$ "I don't think th-[noclick]"

$SP$ "So your client, the supposed innocent one, was always living in the shadow,"
$SP$ "while her sister got all the fame and glory. Even though, she worked so hard."
$SP$ "I mean have you SEEN her room? It's freakin crazy in there! It's like some sort of music creation dungeon."
$SP$ "Annnd you're telling me, that she's still innocent?"
$SP$ "That she didn't give in and decide to get rid of the problem? So she could finally be free?"
$SP$ "C'mon, we both know that that's what really matters. The motive to be free."
